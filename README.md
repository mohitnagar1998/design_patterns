# 🎯 Design Patterns in Python

This repository contains Python implementations of various **Object-Oriented Design Patterns**, each accompanied by a **UML-style diagram** and **example code** to demonstrate real-world usage.

The goal of this project is to provide **clear, practical, and easy-to-understand examples** for mastering design patterns in Python.

## 🧩 Implemented Patterns

| Pattern | Category | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Abstract Factory | Creational | Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. |
| Factory Method | Creational | Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. |
| Decorator | Structural | Allows adding new functionality to objects dynamically without modifying their structure. |
| Proxy | Structural | Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. |
| Observer | Behavioral | Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one changes state, all dependents are notified. |
| Chain of Responsibility | Behavioral | Passes requests along a chain of handlers, where each handler decides either to process the request or pass it along. |
| Strategy | Behavioral | Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable at runtime. |
| Null Object | Behavioral | Replaces null references with a do-nothing object to eliminate null checks and simplify client code. |
